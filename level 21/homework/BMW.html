                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in the Kingdom of Bavaria, 
                        which was a state of the German Empire. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische
                         Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, 
                         the name BMW dates back to 1913, when a company to use the name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as 
                         Rapp Motorenwerke. The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to 
                         Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year.[7] BMW's first product was produced 
                         for fighter aircraft of the Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa, 
                         designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business 
                         by producing motorcycle engines, agricultural equipment, household items, and railway brakes. The company
                         produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32, in 1923.</p>

                        <p>Company name
                            BMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke. This name is grammatically incorrect (in German, 
                            compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name, Bayerische 
                            Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩vɛɐ̯kə] ⓘ) has been used in several publications and 
                            advertisements in the past.[18][19] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates into English as Bavarian Motor Works.[20] 
                            The suffix AG, short for Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by shareholders, thus akin to "Inc."
                             (US) or PLC, "Public Limited Company" (UK).
                            
                            The terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are sometimes used as slang for BMW in the English language[21][22] and are
                             sometimes used interchangeably for cars and motorcycles.[23][24][25]</p>
