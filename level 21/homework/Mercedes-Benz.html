                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Mercedes-Benz commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury 
                            and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz 
                            AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established 
                            in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
                            [1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles 
                            and light commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz. From 
                            November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles 
                            (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz 
                            Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. 
                            In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 
                            2.31 million passenger cars.[8] </p>
